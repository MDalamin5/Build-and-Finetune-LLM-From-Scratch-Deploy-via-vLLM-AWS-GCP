# 🧠 Build LLM from Scratch

A comprehensive end-to-end repository documenting the entire process of **building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch** and mastering **deep learning with PyTorch**. This repo combines two powerful learning tracks:

* **Vizuara's "Building LLMs From Scratch" series**
* **CampusX's "Practical Deep Learning using PyTorch" series**

Whether you're a beginner or advancing your AI engineering skills, this repo gives you theory, code, experiments, and practical projects.
